# Audit timeline

We are always working to tighten up our processes in order to be able to distribute awards and publish reports more quickly. Here's our estimated timeline:

| Phase             | Description             | Goal | Actual (average) |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --- | --- |
| Submissions close | Audit submissions close | Day 1 | Day 1 |
| Triage | Validators triage findings | Day 3-4 | Day 3-4 |
| Sponsor review | Sponsors review and give feedback on findings | Day 7 | Day 9-10 |
| Judging | Judges determine validity and severity | Day 12 | Day 19-21 |
| Post-judging QA | Judging QA complete; awards announced | Day 15 | Day 21-22 |
| Awarding | Awards are distributed; Sponsors complete mitigation of any issues | Day 15 | Day 25-39 |
| Report published | Audit report is published; Audit issues are made public | Day 21 | Day 40-60 |

Presently, the process takes us longer than the ideal, but we are actively working to improve our planning and processes that will smooth out the rough spots that slow things down.
