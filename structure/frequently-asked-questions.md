# Code4rena FAQ

### What is Code4rena?

[Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) is a competitive audit platform that finds more high-severity vulnerabilities, more quickly than any other auditing method. Built by a team of leading industry experts, Code4rena is designed to protect your project and community by providing access to the best security researchers and smart contract experts in the world.

### How is Code4rena different from other audit companies?

At Code4rena, we live by the motto “[the more eyes on the code, the more bugs found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1rKwDv5kLQ)”. By harnessing the power of the Code4rena community, projects have access to unmatched value when considering engineer hours of code review.

Our platform is designed to incentivize everyone to participate in finding vulnerabilities. In contrast to other audit companies or bug bounty facilitators, there isn’t a race to find the biggest one as fast as possible. Everyone who puts in the effort and finds something valid will be rewarded, thereby increasing participation levels and the scope of vulnerabilities found.

### Can anyone participate?

In short, yes! Anyone can become a Code4rena Warden, and plenty of resources are available to learn more and earn rewards. You can find out more about this in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena).

### What’s the difference between Wardens and Masons?

The simplest way to define the difference between Wardens and Masons is this: Wardens contribute to the ecosystem by auditing code and identifying vulnerabilities, while Masons leverage unique skills outside of auditing to contribute. Examples of Mason contributions could include things like explainer videos, blogs, mentorship programs etc. 

### How do I sign up to be a Warden?

Jump into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena) and get started! From there, you’ll need to [register](https://code4rena.com/register) as a Warden, then say hi in our #i-want-to-be-a-warden Discord channel. 

### Can I change my username? 

At this time we do not support username changes. You can register with a new username if you wish, but your new user account would start from zero on the leaderboard, and your existing username will remain visible if it is already on the leaderboard. 

### How can I become a Judge?

Complete [this form](https://code4rena.com/judge-application/) and share: Short bio/intro and summary of relevant experience, links that help demonstrate your expertise, 3 example submissions to Code4rena contests that were judged high severity, description of how each submission demonstrates your depth of knowledge.

### How can I become a Scout?

You can’t, just yet! Right now, Scouts are hand-picked by the C4 team as it’s a highly sensitive role. We’re looking at the possibility of opening up this process, but not in the near future.

### I want Code4rena to audit my project, where do I start?

It’s really simple! Just visit [this link](https://code4rena.typeform.com/i-want-an-audit) and fill out the form. Our team will be in touch with you shortly after you’ve completed it.

### Do you have a blog?

We do indeed, [here](https://medium.com/code-423n4). We post product updates, sponsor interviews and more.

### What’s the best way to stay up to date with Code4rena?

[Follow us](https://twitter.com/code4rena) on Twitter and turn on notifications in our #announcements channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena). 

### Where can I view the audit results?

Once an audit's results have been finalized, they’ll be shared in our #announcements channel in Discord. The audit's page in the ‘[Audits](https://code4rena.com/contests)’ section on our website will also be updated to show results.

### Where can I read past Code4rena audit reports?

We push all public audit reports to the ‘[Reports](https://code4rena.com/reports)’ section on our website. This enables you to read through past findings, evaluate commonalities, and continue your learning journey. Our [GitHub](https://github.com/code-423n4/) repos are also public, for those of you interested in diving deeper.

### How are audits judged?

We have a lot of documents outlining the technicalities of our judging process, which you can view [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/judges/how-to-judge-a-contest). In short, Judges follow stringent criteria, whilst making sure submissions adhere to C4 policies. We’ve also implemented a severity standardization guide to ensure a homogenized approach. 

### How can I verify a legitimate member of Code4arena staff?

All Code4rena staff have the `staff` role in the Code4rena Discord server. You can check their roles by clicking on their username or profile picture. 

### Who makes all the great art for C4? 

Code4rena works with an amazing team of artists, led by [Jaime Robles](https://bsky.app/profile/brownies4thedead.bsky.social).

## Warden FAQ

### How do I submit issues to an audit?

Simply navigate to the audit page, click on the `Submit Findings` button, and fill out the form with your findings. Make sure to validate your wallet address beforehand.

### How can I confirm that Code4rena has received my finding?

Simply head over to the specific audit page and navigate to the `Findings` tab. If you see your issue listed, then it is already received by the C4 team.

You should also receive an email confirmation from submissions@code4rena.com. (If you don’t see it in your inbox, check your spam folder.)

### I submitted a finding but then realized it was invalid. Do I need to contact Code4rena?

You can go to the `Findings` tab on the audit page and open the specific finding. There you will see an option to `Withdraw` the finding.

### Can I edit my findings post-submission?

Yes! Go to the `Findings` tab on the audit page and open the concerned finding, make edits and submit changes. This option is only available until the audit deadline, though. 

### What if I want to change my wallet address?

You can change your payment information at any time. Simply log in and go to [your account management page](https://code4rena.com/account).

Note: for each audit, C4 distributes awards to the payment address on file *at the time of award calculation*.

### Why was my finding marked as invalid?

The validity of an audit report submission is not based on whether it is ‘true’ or not. A report may contain a finding which is factually 'true' (the most literal interpretation of 'valid'), but if it does not add value or if it is not presented in such a way that adds value to a sponsor, it may be deemed invalid by a judge.

### Why was my finding downgraded from the severity I gave it?

Explaining and rationalizing the potential impact is an essential part of a quality submission. The burden of proof increases based on the potential value of the submission (rarity, severity). Judges will refer to the criteria on [this page](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria#estimating-risk-tl-dr) to ascertain whether a finding matches the severity a warden has initially given it.

### Do Judges have the final say?

They do. Judges review findings and sponsor input, and come to their own independent conclusion in alignment with our criteria. Doing this ensures the impartiality of the process. You can read more about our approach to this [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria).

### Is the judging criteria set in stone, or does it change?

We’re an organization that aims to refine our processes wherever and whenever possible. At present, there is [this page](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues) on our GitHub to discuss open issues in regards to judging standardization.

### If I’ve got questions about the severity I should assign to a finding, where should I go?

In the C4 Discord, these types of questions are commonly asked in #questions and/or #wardens.

## FAQ about Analyses

## What is the difference between QA and analysis?

QA reports include specific issues that are non-critical or low severity; Analysis is intended to give wardens the opportunity to share high level advice and review of the code.

QA/HMs are "trees" to analyses' "forest." For a long time wardens have wanted a better place to contribute value on (and get credit and compensation for) high level overviews and advice that aren't necessarily covered by specific bugs.

Over time, we expect the best analyses will result in a diverse set of "consultative" advice to augment "here's a set of bugs."

## Can I see an example of an analysis?

Sure - your best bet is to look at the Reports section of the Code4rena website, and read through reports for audits that ran on or after June 6, 2023. Here are three examples:

- [Analysis of Angle Protocol by warden __141345__](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-06-angle#audit-analysis)
- [Analysis of Llama by warden 0xnev](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-06-llama#audit-analysis)
- [Analysis of Nouns DAO by warden 0xnev](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-07-nounsdao#audit-analysis)

## Where is the Analysis submission form?

Every C4 audit that includes an Analysis pool will have a submission form for Analyses that is separate from the finding submission form. You can find the correct submission form by navigating to the audit on the Code4rena website while logged in. You should see a "Submit Analysis report" option when you hover over the “Make a submission” button.

## I’m a non-native English speaker. Will I be penalized for language differences?

As with all Code4rena submissions, judges are asked to assess analyses based on their content; we aren’t looking for perfect grammar. 

That being said, if you prefer, you may submit your analysis in another language, and C4’s judge and lookout will use translation tools to read it. When possible, we will pull in Judges and Lookouts who speak the language.

## Are analyses a part of **all** Code4rena audits?

Not quite yet, but we expect they will be a core feature of all Code4rena audits in the near future. 

For now, you can tell which audits have Analyses by looking at the award pool details in:

- the #rsvp channel in the Code4rena Discord server,
- the audit repo, or
- the audit page on the [Code4rena.com](http://Code4rena.com) website.

## How do judges assess Analyses?

The judging rubric for Analyses is still emerging, but we asked our judges for advice and here’s what they told us:

> It is mostly qualitative analysis based on how deep the report went and the value provided.
Here are a couple of suggestions:
> 
> - **Architecture** - How does this codebase compare to others you're familiar with? What ideas can be incorporated? What are some architecture-level weak spots and how can they be mitigated?
> - **Centralization** - What are all the trust assumptions laid out in the contract? How can they be reduced with little friction?
> - **Systemic risks** - List out all the external conditions that could make contracts behave in an unsafe way. Consider analyzing their likelihood and suggest ways to reduce their impact, or check for them at runtime.
> - **Documentation / Mental model** - Lay out diagrams with all the different components in play and how they interact with each other.

## What if I have a limited amount of time to spend on an audit, but still want to submit a finding? Is there still value in submitting an analysis?

Yes. You can simply state in your analysis that you spent a limited amount of time with the code base. Even a brief analysis helps Lookouts and Judges understand your approach and perspective. 

## What happened to Basic Analyses?

When Code4rena announced Analyses in June 2023, we hoped this new report category would incentivize and reward the many wardens whose expertise includes architecture and systemic risk advice, as well as providing judges and projects with insight into wardens' workflows and learning processes. 

The results so far tell us that Advanced Analyses provide precisely the value to projects that we hoped they would. 👏 Wardens’ observations and acuity within this report category have been met with deep appreciation.

Basic Analyses have not quite delivered the value we had hoped for, so we have removed them from future audits, effective August 18, 2023.
