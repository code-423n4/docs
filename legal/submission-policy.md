# Submission policy

Code4rena is an open organization committed to improving the security of decentralized protocols while protecting the information of our sponsors and participants. This policy is intended to provide C4 Wardens (security researchers) clear guidelines for participating in code audits while conducting vulnerability discovery activities. This policy forms a binding agreement between C4 and You. By participating in code audits You agree to abide by this and any other applicable C4 policies.

The following policy conveys C4’s preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to the organization and describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to share vulnerability reports, and the length of time we expect Wardens to wait prior to publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.

Reports can be submitted at any point prior to stop time for a given audit. The details for each code audit can be found through [the Code4rena website](https://code4rena.com/).

All community members agree to be bound by the Code4rena Code of Conduct, which can be viewed [in the Code4rena Discord](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/851883682470166558/851891396255940618).

Under this policy, audit contests covers activities in which you:

* Register as a C4 Warden within an individual capacity or as part of a team.
* Submit your bug report using the submission form.

## Audit contest guidelines

* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data, especially in regard to funds.
* Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise funds, exfiltrate data, establish persistent permissioning access, or use the exploit to redirect to other systems.
* **Wait until the audit report has been published** before you disclose any findings or submissions publicly.
* Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

In the event that you encounter a critical vulnerability that the sponsor project would want to know about, even before the end of the audit, please refer to ["How to submit Zero-day or otherwise highly sensitive bugs."](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-guidelines#how-to-submit-zero-day-or-otherwise-highly-sensitive-bugs)

> Without explicit permission from Code4rena staff, publishing or discussing findings publicly prior to report publication is grounds for immediate forfeit of award and disqualification from any future C4 events and activities.

## Unauthorized test methods

The following methods are not authorized means of testing within C4 code audits:

* Testing exploits on deployed contracts or systems.
* Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests or other tests that impair access to or damage a system or data.
* Physical testing (e.g. office access, open doors, tailgating), social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing), or any other non-technical vulnerability testing.
