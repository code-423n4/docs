# Code4rena

Code4rena (C4) is a competitive audit and bounty platform where security researchers, referred to as [Wardens](/roles/), review, audit, and analyze codebases for security vulnerabilities in exchange for bounties provided by sponsoring projects.

The players in the arena:

* [**Wardens**](/roles/) protect the DeFi ecosystem from threats by auditing code.
* [**Sponsors**](/sponsors) create prize pools to attract wardens to audit their project.
* [**Judges**](/roles/judges) decide the severity, validity, and quality of findings and rate the performance of wardens.
