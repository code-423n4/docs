# Appealing a verdict

Sponsors may choose to appeal a judge's verdict for their Code4rena audit, if they wish to formally contest the assessed validity and/or risk level of one or more findings.

## Appellate court composition, voting, and fees

[Per the Supreme Court’s recommendation](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/supreme-court-decisions-fall-2023#recommendation-appeal-committee):

- A panel of 3 judges RSVP on demand per audit.
  - One seat of the appellate court is reserved for a member of the Supreme Court, unless none are available.
  - RSVP priority is based on Supreme Court role, followed by number of competitions judged.
  - Original judge cannot be part of panel.
  - Any judges who have submissions involved in the appeal must recuse themselves.
- Judge appeal panel determines what evidence and deliberation they require in order to make an objective assessment.
- Judge panel prioritizes a swift but thoroughly considered decision.
- Overruling the previous verdict requires 2/3 consensus at minimum.
- If the overruling is voted with a 3/3 consensus, then it's labeled as a clear mistake.
- If the Overruling is voted with only 2/3 votes, it is considered a mistake — but not a clear mistake.

## Costs and fees

- Code4rena collects an appeal deposit of $1000 USDC per appealed finding. (If your audit includes refundable award pools, an appeals deposit will be collected prior to your audit start date.)
- In case of a clear mistake (3/3 consensus to overturn the original verdict), the $1000 court fee is deducted from the original judge’s fee, and the sponsor’s appeal deposit is returned.
- In case of a 2/3 consensus (mistake, but not a clear mistake), the court fee is paid by Code4rena, and the sponsor is refunded 50% of their appeal deposit.
- If the appellate court rules in favour of the original judge’s decision (i.e. only 0/3 or 1/3 judges vote to overturn the original decision), the sponsor's appeal deposit is paid out to the appeals court.
- Regardless of outcome, $700 is distributed to the appellate court judges ($200 USDC per judge, per appealed issue, plus $100 per issue for the lead judge); the remainder goes to Code4rena to cover the administrative costs of the appeal.


## Appeal process

- Prior to going to appeal, the sponsor team may communicate with original judge, in a channel with staff visibility for transparency purposes.
- In order to appeal a judge’s decision, the sponsor must have commented on all issues they intend to appeal during the post-judging QA phase, and provide the original judge with sufficient context to judge it correctly. 
- Sponsors should communicate their intent to appeal, and the findings they wish to appeal, to C4 staff during (or *immediately* following) post-judging QA. Once judging has been finalized and awards have been announced, an appeal is no longer possible.
- Appeals will be judged primarily using the information provided in the initial report and post-judging QA, in order to assess whether the original judge made an error, or was simply provided with insufficient context.
- Evidence collected, method of deliberation, and conclusions reached by each judge will be presented transparently to the community.
- Appellate court judgments will be applied to the submissions in question and factored into awarding and reporting.
- The appellate court’s brief will be shared publicly alongside the audit results.
- All parties agree the appeal decision is final and cannot be further appealed.

## Appeals re: severity categorization

Code4rena judges use a standard severity categorization, [which is defined here](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization). Code4rena’s Supreme Court meets periodically to review "case law" and standardize these definitions further; the Supreme Court’s decisions are then added to the Severity Categorization page in the docs for the judges’ reference. **When considering an appeal regarding severity categorization, please review the definitions carefully.**
