# Certified Security Researchers (formerly +Backstage wardens)

Certified contributors who meet certain performance criteria within C4 gain the Certified Security Researcher (SR) role, which provides access to:

- Findings repos, immediately after audits conclude
- Post-judging QA

The minimum criteria to become a Certified SR are as follows: 

1. Be approved as a Certified C4 contributor;
1. Submit valid findings to at least 3 Code4rena audits (i.e. valid findings on the [Code4rena leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard/));
1. Have at least 1 high severity finding OR 3 medium severity findings on the [Code4rena leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard/), OR score A on a QA report, Gas report, or Analysis (formerly "Advanced Analysis"; basic Analysis grades are not eligible);
1. Abide by the Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions (see application form (temporarily unavailable)).

## To request the SR role

Once you meet the eligibility criteria, submit a [Help Desk Request](https://code4rena.com/help/) to request the SR role, and C4 staff will get you set up.

You should also verify your Github account via [your Code4rena account management screen](https://code4rena.com/account), in order to access private repos.

## Certified contributor professional conduct guidelines

Contributors may lose their SR role by violating the code of professional conduct as outlined in the certified contributor agreement. This code asks wardens to:

- take an objective, collegial, and intellectually open tone in considering and discussing all findings
- treat wardens and sponsors, and all other Code4rena community members with respect and an assumption of positive intent
- avoid engaging in any discussion and evaluation of issues they submitted themselves except to answer a question or provide additional context requested by a judge or sponsor
- treat the contents of all findings as private and confidential until the audit report is made public.
