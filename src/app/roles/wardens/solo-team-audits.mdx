# Hire C4 wardens for a solo (or team) audit 

[Certified Wardens](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors) and teams have the opportunity to book solo or team audits through Code4rena, via the “Available for hire” function in their website profiles. These audits are performed by one warden (or team) who reviews the sponsor’s code and produces a report. ([Here’s an example](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-07-canto/) of a solo audit performed by a Code4rena warden.)

- The process of booking a solo or team audit begins with a project team member clicking the “Get a quote” button on the profile for a warden or team, and sharing scoping details with Code4rena staff.
- Code4rena staff will then consult with the warden (or team) and project contact(s) to firm up scoping, pricing, and dates.

## Benefits to projects and wardens

- When a solo or team audit is booked via a profile’s “Available for hire” function, both the warden (or team) and the project have direct access to Code4rena staff for assistance with:
    - Legal agreements
    - Scoping, pricing, and logistical planning
    - Collection and disbursement of funds
    - External accountability via a Code4rena Judge
- This top-tier support you’ll receive from the Code4rena team is built into the solo audit booking model, at only 20% of the total audit fee.

## How can I opt in to solo / team audits?

If you are a Certified warden, you can make yourself available for solo audits by logging in to your [user account on the Code4rena website](https://code4rena.com/account/edit-profile), and opting in to the “Available for hire” function on the Settings screen.

For warden teams, all wardens on the team must be Certified wardens. The process is the same except that you must enable the "Available for hire" function on your **team's** profile settings screen.
