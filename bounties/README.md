# Judging process for Code4rena bug bounties

Unless otherwise noted in the bounty's `README`, bounty submissions are judged by the sponsor team. The following guidelines apply to sponsor-judged bounties. 

## Sponsor judging responsibilities

Sponsors are responsible for reviewing and assessing submitted findings, and providing a written response indicating their determination, within a timely manner.

Code4rena will make best efforts to share sponsors' written responses with the warden who reported the finding as soon as possible.

Findings which do not receive a sponsor response within 14 days of submission are closed by default.

## Appeals process for bounty programs

Wardens may choose to appeal a sponsor's verdict for a Code4rena bounty submission, if they wish to formally contest the assessed validity and/or risk level of one or more findings.

In the event of a judge appeal, with permission from the sponsor, Code4rena staff will select judge(s), affiliated with Code4rena or independent, and the appointed judges will apply the bounty judging criteria to the relevant findings. Code4rena will administer the appeal process at its discretion. Decisions after an appeal are binding and final with respect to a findingâ€™s validity, severity, and remuneration due to the warden who reported the finding.
