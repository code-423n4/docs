# Joining competitions and bounties

Code4rena audits let people of a wide range of skill levels get rewarded while showcasing their talent in order to make the DeFi ecosystem more secure.

✨Stay up to date with new audits by [following C4 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/code4rena) and joining our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/EY5dvm3evD).

### Joining an audit

Anyone can register to participate in an audit. [Register here](https://code4rena.com/register/account), confirm your email address, then join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena) so you can keep up with important announcements about C4 audits and bounties.

Once you've completed those verification steps, [visit the C4 website](https://code4rena.com/audits/), where you'll find a list of open and upcoming audits, along with their pool size, start and end date. 

To view specific audit details and other relevant information, you'll need to **click the "Join audit" button.** Once active, the audit page will typically include links to the code repo, and to the finding submission form.

Please familiarize yourself with the [submission policy](/legal/submission-policy) and [judging criteria](/competitions/judging-criteria) prior to participating.

### Questions?

When audit sponsors come to Code4rena for an audit, we always encourage them to provide documentation, and to make themselves available for questions, so they get the most out of their audit.

When a sponsor designates a team member who is available for questions, that person will be introduced in the C4 Discord (in an audit-specific channel). You may start a private thread with them if you have questions; however, please be sure to first review all documentation for the audit to ensure the answer hasn't already been provided.

Most audits also have Code4rena's Documentation Bot enabled; instructions for using the bot are shared in the audit channel in the C4 Discord server. 

_Note: general questions about such topics as auditing or C4 processes should be asked in the `#questions` or `#wardens` channels in the C4 Discord, not directed to the sponsor._

### ⏩ TL;DR

* Turn in your reports before the submission deadline.
* For each audit, submit your Medium and High risk findings individually.
* Bundle all of your low-risk and governance / centralization risk findings into a single QA report.
* Be sure to [register your username and wallet address](https://code4rena.com/register/account) to participate.
* Watch the C4 Discord for award announcements -- if your username is among the winners, [submit your tax information](https://code4rena.com/tax-info) within 30 days to receive your awards.
* Publicly disclosing (e.g. publishing or discussing) any discovered bugs or vulnerabilities before the audit report has been published is grounds for disqualification from all C4 events.
