# SR Wardens

Wardens who meet certain performance criteria within C4 gain the Certified Security Researcher (SR) role, which provides access to:

* Post-judging QA
* Unrestricted number of submissions per audit

The criteria (visible on [your Code4rena account screen](https://code4rena.com/account)) to become a Certified SR are as follows:

1. **Your `signal` is 50% (0.5) or higher.** This is shown at the top of the page, below the “User information” heading.
2. **Your tax information has been accepted.** Scroll down to the “Tax information” section to confirm that your tax information has been accepted. If not, you must submit it to qualify for the SR role.
3. **Your Github account is verified.** You can check this in the “Contributor certification” section.
4. **Be approved as a Certified C4 contributor** -- if all other criteria are met, then you’ll see an option to “Verify your identity.” (If this option is not shown, double-check that you have met all of the other criteria. It will not display unless all other criteria are met.)
5. Abide by the Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions.

## Certified contributors

Contributors who have provided ID verification and agreed to Code4rena's [Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions](https://code4rena.com/certified-contributor-terms-and-conditions) may also be eligible for:

* [Judging](judges.md) opportunities
* Providing mitigation review services

Your certification status persists even if your `signal` drops below the required threshold for the SR role.

## Certification process and constraints

Certification is only available to [SR-eligible wardens](sr-wardens.md).

The certification process is as follows:

1. An eligible contributor submits the Certified Contributor Application form, and agrees to the Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions (see the application form).
2. C4's KYC provider, [Certn](https://certn.co/), contacts the contributor to verify their identity.
3. Certn certifies a contributor as having completed their identity verification process.
4. Code4rena staff onboard the certified contributor once their application has been approved.

In the event that a certified contributor violates or is believed to have violated the Terms and Conditions, Code4rena reserves the right to pursue all remedies available, including removal from the platform or legal action.

### How long does it take to get certified?

* Once you submit the Certified Contributor application form, Code4rena staff will review it before beginning the Certn certification process. It usually takes 1-2 business days to process applications and issue the certification request.
* Certn's verification process can usually be completed within 15 minutes, assuming you have the necessary documents available.
* C4 staff usually process successful certifications within 1-2 business days and will notify you in the C4 Discord when your role has been updated.

## Certified contributor professional conduct guidelines

Contributors may lose their SR role by violating the code of professional conduct as outlined in the certified contributor agreement. This code asks wardens to:

* take an objective, collegial, and intellectually open tone in considering and discussing all findings
* treat wardens and sponsors, and all other Code4rena community members with respect and an assumption of positive intent
* avoid engaging in any discussion and evaluation of issues they submitted themselves except to answer a question or provide additional context requested by a judge or sponsor
* treat the contents of all findings as private and confidential until the audit report is made public.
