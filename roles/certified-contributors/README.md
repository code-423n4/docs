description: In order to create opportunities for contributions which rely on establishment of trust, Code4rena allows community members to opt into certifying their identity and entering into a simple agreement.

---

Contributors who have provided ID verification and agreed to Code4rena's [Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions](https://code4rena.com/certified-contributor-terms-and-conditions) may be eligible to participate in:

- Private or invite-only audits
- Scout role (focused on scoping and pre-audit code intel)
- [Judging](/roles/judges/README.md)
- [Certified Security Researchers opportunities](sr-backstage-wardens.md) (post-audit findings access and post-judging QA)
- Providing mitigation review services

## Certification process and constraints

Certification is available to [SR-eligible wardens](/roles/certified-contributors/sr-backstage-wardens.md). 

The certification process is as follows:

1. An eligible contributor submits the Certified Contributor Application form, and agrees to the Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions (see the application form).
1. C4's KYC provider, [Certn](https://certn.co/), contacts the contributor to certify their identity.
1. Certn certifies a contributor as having completed their identity verification process.
1. Code4rena staff onboard the certified contributor once their application has been approved.

In the event that a certified contributor violates or is believed to have violated the Terms and Conditions, Code4rena reserves the right to pursue all remedies available, including removal from the platform or legal action.

## Invitational relegation

Wardens who RSVP for an invitational and:

- Perform >50% below median gatherer score in an audit, or
- Deliver >50% below median in test coverage points

will lose invitational eligibility for 90 days.

## How long does it take to get certified? 

- Once you submit the Certified Contributor application form, Code4rena staff will review it before beginning the Certn certification process. It usually takes 1-2 business days to process applications and issue the certification request. 
- Certn's verification process can usually be completed within 15 minutes, assuming you have the necessary documents available. 
- C4 staff usually process successful certifications within 1-2 business days and will notify you in the C4 Discord when your role has been updated.
