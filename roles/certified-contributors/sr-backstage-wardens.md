# Certified Security Researchers (formerly +Backstage wardens)

Certified contributors who meet certain performance criteria within C4 gain the Certified Security Researcher (SR) role, which provides access to:

- Submissions to open competitive audits, immediately after submission deadline
- Post-judging QA
- Unrestricted number of submissions per audit

The criteria (visible on [your Code4rena account screen](https://code4rena.com/account)) to become a Certified SR are as follows:

1. **Your `signal` is 50% (0.5) or higher.** This is shown at the top of the page, below the “User information” heading.
1. **Your tax information has been accepted.** Scroll down to the “Tax information” section to confirm that your tax information has been accepted. If not, you must submit it to qualify for the SR role.
1. **Your Github account is verified.** You can check this in the “Contributor certification” section.
1. **Be approved as a Certified C4 contributor** -- if all other criteria are met, then you’ll see an option to “Certify your identity.” (If this option is not shown, double-check that you have met all of the other criteria. It will not display unless all other criteria are met.)
1. Abide by the Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions.

## Certified contributor professional conduct guidelines

Contributors may lose their SR role by violating the code of professional conduct as outlined in the certified contributor agreement. This code asks wardens to:

- take an objective, collegial, and intellectually open tone in considering and discussing all findings
- treat wardens and sponsors, and all other Code4rena community members with respect and an assumption of positive intent
- avoid engaging in any discussion and evaluation of issues they submitted themselves except to answer a question or provide additional context requested by a judge or sponsor
- treat the contents of all findings as private and confidential until the audit report is made public.
