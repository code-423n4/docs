# Audit timeline

We are working on tightening up all of our processes in order to be able to distribute awards and publish reports more quickly. Here's our estimated timeline:

|  | Ideal | Actual (on average) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit submissions close | Day 1 | Day 1 |
| Validators triage findings | Day 3-4 | Day 3-4 |
| Sponsors review and give feedback on findings | Day 7 | Day 9-10 |
| Judges determine final severity | Day 12 | Day 19-21 |
| Judging QA complete; awards announced | Day 15 | Day 21-22 |
| Awards are distributed; Sponsors complete mitigation of any issues | Day 15 | Day 25-39 |
| Audit report is published; Audit issues are made public | Day 21 | Day 40-60 |

Presently, the process takes us longer than the ideal, but we are actively working to improve our planning and processes that will smooth out the rough spots that slow things down.
