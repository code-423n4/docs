# FAQ

### What is Code4rena?

[Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) is a competitive audit platform that finds more high-severity vulnerabilities, more quickly than any other auditing method. Built by a team of leading industry experts, Code4rena is designed to protect your project and community by providing access to the best security researchers and smart contract experts in the world.

### How is Code4rena different from other audit companies?

At Code4rena, we live by the motto “[the more eyes on the code, the more bugs found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1rKwDv5kLQ)”. By harnessing the power of the Code4rena community, projects have access to unmatched value when considering engineer hours of code review.

Our platform is designed to incentivize everyone to participate in finding vulnerabilities. In contrast to other audit companies or bug bounty facilitators, there isn’t a race to find the biggest one as fast as possible. Everyone who puts in the effort and finds something valid will be rewarded, thereby increasing participation levels and the scope of vulnerabilities found.

### Can anyone participate?

In short, yes! Anyone can become a Code4rena Warden, and plenty of resources are available to learn more and earn rewards. You can find out more about this in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena).

### How do I sign up to be a Warden?

[Head over here](https://code4rena.com/register/account) to register as a Warden.

### Can I change my username?

At this time we do not support username changes. You can register with a new username if you wish, but your new user account would start from zero on the leaderboard, and your existing username will remain visible if it is already on the leaderboard.

### How can I become a Judge?

Complete [this form](https://code4rena.com/judge-application/) and share: Short bio/intro and summary of relevant experience, links that help demonstrate your expertise, 3 example submissions to Code4rena contests that were judged high severity, description of how each submission demonstrates your depth of knowledge.

### How can I become a Scout?

You can’t, just yet! Right now, Scouts are hand-picked by the C4 team as it’s a highly sensitive role. We’re looking at the possibility of opening up this process, but not in the near future.

### I want Code4rena to audit my project, where do I start?

It’s really simple! Just visit [this link](https://code4rena.typeform.com/i-want-an-audit) and fill out the form. Our team will be in touch with you shortly after you’ve completed it.

### Do you have a blog?

We do indeed, [here](https://code4rena.com/blog). We post product updates, sponsor interviews and more.

### What’s the best way to stay up to date with Code4rena?

[Follow us](https://twitter.com/code4rena) on Twitter and turn on notifications in our #c4-updates channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena).

### Where can I view the audit results?

Once an audit's results have been finalized, they’ll be shared in our #announcements channel in Discord. The audit's page in the ‘[Audits](https://code4rena.com/contests)’ section on our website will also be updated to show results.

### Where can I read past Code4rena audit reports?

We push all public audit reports to the ‘[Reports](https://code4rena.com/reports)’ section on our website. This enables you to read through past findings, evaluate commonalities, and continue your learning journey. Our [GitHub](https://github.com/code-423n4/) repos are also public, for those of you interested in diving deeper.

### How are audits judged?

We have a lot of documents outlining the technicalities of our judging process, which you can view [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/judges/how-to-judge-a-contest). In short, Judges follow stringent criteria, whilst making sure submissions adhere to C4 policies. We’ve also implemented a severity standardization guide to ensure a homogenized approach.

### How can I verify a legitimate member of Code4arena staff?

All Code4rena staff have the `staff` role in the Code4rena Discord server. You can check their roles by clicking on their username or profile picture.

### Who makes all the great art for C4?

Code4rena works with an amazing team of artists, led by [Jaime Robles](https://bsky.app/profile/brownies4thedead.bsky.social).

### What does "HM" stand for?

"HM" is Code4rena shorthand for "High and Medium risk findings." C4 audits typically have an HM award pool that is distributed according to our [incentive model](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards/README.md).

## Warden FAQ

### How do I submit issues to an audit?

Simply navigate to the audit page, click on the `Submit Findings` button, and fill out the form with your findings. Make sure to validate your wallet address beforehand.

### How can I confirm that Code4rena has received my finding?

Simply head over to the specific audit page and navigate to the `Your Findings` tab (located to the right of `Details`). If you see your issue listed, then it is already received by the C4 team.

You should also receive an email confirmation from submissions@code4rena.com. (If you don’t see it in your inbox, check your spam folder.)

### I submitted a finding but then realized it was invalid. Do I need to contact Code4rena?

While the audit is still active, you can go to the `Your Findings` tab (located to the right of `Details`) on the specific audit page and open the finding. There you will see an option to `Withdraw` the finding.

### Can I edit my findings post-submission?

Yes! Go to the `Your Findings` tab (located to the right of `Details`) on the specific audit page and open the concerned finding, make edits and submit changes. This option is only available until the audit deadline, though.

### What if I want to change my wallet address?

You can change your payment information at any time. Simply log in and go to [your account management page](https://code4rena.com/account).

Note: for each audit, C4 distributes awards to the payment address on file _at the time of award calculation_.

### Why was my finding marked as invalid?

The validity of an audit report submission is not based on whether it is ‘true’ or not. A report may contain a finding which is factually 'true' (the most literal interpretation of 'valid'), but if it does not add value or if it is not presented in such a way that adds value to a sponsor, it may be deemed invalid by a judge.

### Why was my finding downgraded from the severity I gave it?

Explaining and rationalizing the potential impact is an essential part of a quality submission. The burden of proof increases based on the potential value of the submission (rarity, severity). Judges will refer to the criteria on [this page](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria#estimating-risk-tl-dr) to ascertain whether a finding matches the severity a warden has initially given it.

### Do Judges have the final say?

While sponsor input is a significant criterion, ultimately judges have final say in determining validity and severity of issues, as well as whether/how issues are considered duplicates. If wardens have fact-based evidence of a vulnerability's existence, they are welcome to submit it in accordance with C4's [submission guidelines](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-guidelines). Judges will review submissions and sponsor input to come to their own independent conclusion in alignment with our criteria. Doing this ensures the impartiality of the process. You can read more about our approach to this [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria).

### Is the judging criteria set in stone, or does it change?

We’re an organization that aims to refine our processes wherever and whenever possible. At present, there is [this page](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues) on our GitHub to discuss open issues in regards to judging standardization.

### If I’ve got questions about the severity I should assign to a finding, where should I go?

In the C4 Discord, these types of questions are commonly asked in #questions and/or #wardens.
