## FAQ / troubleshooting

### Can't find email verification message

If you can't find the email verification message:

1. Log in and go to [code4rena.com/account](https://code4rena.com/account).
2. Navigate to the 'Account Verification' section and select 'Re-send Email'.
3. Check your inbox for the new email and click the link to confirm your email address.

### Discord verification

If you can't see most channels in the Code4rena Discord server, your Discord verification may be incomplete. The `warden` role in Discord is automatically assigned when the verification process is successfully completed. To troubleshoot:

1. **Check** [**discord.com**](https://discord.com) **in your web browser.** You may be logged into a different Discord account in your web browser, and if so, that Discord account has received the warden role instead.
2. Log out of Discord.
3. **Perform the Discord verification again:** Log into the account you want associated with your C4 user account, in the same browser you are using to interact with code4rena.com. Next, head to your account settings and perform the Discord verification again.

### Github verification (optional)

Certified and SR wardens should verify their Github accounts in order to access private repos.

**Note:** Ensure that you are logged in to the correct GitHub account before starting the verification process.

To verify your GitHub account on Code4rena, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Code4rena account.
2. Go to the [**Account Settings**](https://code4rena.com/account) page.
3. Look for the section labeled **User Information**.
4. Check if your GitHub account is verified.
5. If not verified, click the **Verify** link next to "Please verify your GitHub account."
6. You will be redirected to GitHub for authorization.
7. On the GitHub authorization page, click **Authorize**.
8. You will be redirected back to Code4rena, and you should see "âœ“ GitHub verified" if successful.

Your GitHub account is now successfully linked and verified on Code4rena!
