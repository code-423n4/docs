# Code4rena

The players in the arena:

* [**Wardens**](roles/wardens/) protect the DeFi ecosystem from threats by auditing code.
* [**Sponsors**](roles/sponsors/) create prize pools to attract wardens to audit their project.
* [**Judges**](roles/judges/) decide the severity, validity, and quality of findings and rate the performance of wardens.
