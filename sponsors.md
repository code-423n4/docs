# Sponsors

Any project can submit a request to sponsor a C4 audit. Just [complete this form](https://go.code4rena.com/start) and we will reach out to set up a meeting or send over a scoping questionnaire to get the ball rolling.

One of our team members will review your repo, assess your responses and contracts, and recommend which audit package would be appropriate for your scope. 

**If you decide to move ahead with an audit, all relevant code will be made public at the time of your audit in most cases.** We also offer KYC and private competitions if privacy is a need; just let our team know.  

## Determining pot size

To attract warden participation in the highly competitive engineering market, we will advise you on standard award pool sizes based on the scope of the audit. We regularly evaluate and adjust audit pricing to ensure incentive alignment with wardens. Sponsors always have the option of boosting their award pool, which tends to attract more warden talent and attention.

## Org fee

There is a fee on top of the determined audit pool, which goes to Code4rena to cover the costs associated with organizing, promoting, and reporting on audits.

## Audit scheduling

Our standard, one-week audits start and end on weekdays at 20:00:00 UTC. Due to high demand, we only lock audits into the schedule after receiving a deposit for the audit.

To provide your team with the most efficient and effective code review, we require your team to add ALL code, documentation, and notes to your audit repo at least 2 business days prior to your audit start time.
